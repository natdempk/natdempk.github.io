I'm a fifth year Computer Science student currently enrolled at Northeastern University.

I've spent my first two co-ops doing backend programming at Akamai Technologies and web application development at InsightSquared. I spent my third co-op at HubSpot working on their email backend, and I'll be going back there full-time after I graduate.

I encourage you to check out my [projects](/projects/), [GitHub](https://github.com/natdempk), [resume](/assets/pdf/Resume Nathaniel Dempkowski 2015-10-12.pdf), or other online profiles using the icons above.
