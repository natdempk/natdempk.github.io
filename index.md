I'm a Computer Science student currently enrolled at Northeastern University.

I've spent my first two co-ops doing backend programming at Akamai Technologies and web application development at InsightSquared. I'm currently searching for a third co-op.

I encourage you to check out my [projects](/projects/), [GitHub](https://github.com/natdempk), [resume](/assets/pdf/Resume Nathaniel Dempkowski 2015-10-12.pdf) or my other online profiles using the icons above.
